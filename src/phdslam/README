PHD SLAM node for the girona500.
The g500slam.py node performs localisation and mapping. Use slamsim.py to simulate point targets.

Dependencies:
The simulator depends on gtk and glade libraries. The Python interface is required as well.
The slam node depends on libgsl and python-scipy.

BLAS DEBUG:
Set lib.common.blas.DEBUG to False to disable basic checks on function arguments. This reduces function overhead, but can result in segfaults or *silent failures* if incorrect arguments are specified. Recommend that DEBUG be disabled only when all testing is complete.
